# GoogleMap Atm Finder
The ATM FINDER Android Application provides a geographical presentation of ATMs of a Bank on the map along with details about them and their status (in service or not).
The application is actually a Geographic Informational System/Application, used from the clients of the Bank, in order to help them to find the nearest in service/suitable ATM to their location or a specific place or their way to a place (between 2 locations).
The application shows the map and the best route with directions to the ATM, from their location or point/points of interest for the clients. Also, the clients can save their points of interest (favorite places).
